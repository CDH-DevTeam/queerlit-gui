# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

As this project is a user-facing application, the places in the semantic versioning number `MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH` are redefined as follows:

- `MAJOR` denotes changes that are expected to significantly disrupt the flow of a returning user with some experience of the application, _or_ that significantly affects the development workflow
- `MINOR` denotes changes that may affect the user experience _or_ the development workflow
- `PATCH` denotes changes that are insignificant to the user experience or the development workflow

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Bug when erasing thesaurus search text
- Reset sort when clicking logo

### [2.5.0] (2023-12-20)

### Added

- Collapse "sidebar" (navigation panel) on mobile, except on Search/Thesaurus page with empty search

### Changed

- The search button on a term page now overwrites any current search query

- Renamed single-word components to multi-word, pursuing [Vue style guide](https://vuejs.org/style-guide/rules-essential)

### Fixed
